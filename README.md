# news-aggregator-
This project is a simple yet effective news aggregator designed for a hackathon. It is built using HTML and CSS, making it a static website with multiple sections for easy navigation. The aggregator allows users to sign in or sign up, then access a dashboard featuring news, videos, about, and contact sections.
